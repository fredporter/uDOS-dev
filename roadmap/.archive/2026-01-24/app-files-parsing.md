1. Text-based coding file extensions & what editors can do with them

A. “First-class” programming languages

These have full syntax highlighting, AST parsing, predictive coding, ghost text, refactors, linters, ligatures.

Extension	Language	Syntax Highlight	Predictive Coding	Ghost Text	Ligatures
.ts	TypeScript	✅ Excellent	✅ Excellent	✅ (Copilot etc)	✅
.js	JavaScript	✅	✅	✅	✅
.py	Python	✅	✅	✅	⚠️ Limited
.rs	Rust	✅	✅	⚠️	✅
.go	Go	✅	✅	⚠️	⚠️
.java	Java	✅	✅	⚠️	⚠️
.c .cpp	C / C++	✅	⚠️	⚠️	⚠️

Key point:
If uDOS wants serious predictive behaviour, .ts and .py are your strongest substrates.

⸻

B. Declarative / config languages

Strong highlighting, weaker prediction, but excellent structural clarity.

Extension	Use	Highlight	Prediction	Ghost	Ligatures
.json	Data	✅	⚠️	❌	❌
.yaml / .yml	Config	✅	⚠️	❌	❌
.toml	Config	✅	⚠️	❌	❌
.xml	Markup	✅	⚠️	❌	❌
.ini	Config	⚠️	❌	❌	❌


⸻

C. Markup & hybrid text formats

This is where uDOS lives.

Extension	Highlight	Prediction	Ghost	Notes
.md	✅	⚠️	⚠️	Context-aware only
.mdx	✅	✅	⚠️	Markdown + JS
.rst	⚠️	❌	❌	Docs-heavy
.tex	✅	⚠️	❌	Maths/layout

👉 Markdown becomes powerful when code blocks are typed and tagged.

⸻

D. “Executable text” / scripting hybrids

These are semantic documents rather than pure code.

Extension	Purpose	Highlight	Prediction
.sh	Shell	✅	⚠️
.bash	Shell	✅	⚠️
.ps1	PowerShell	✅	⚠️
.lua	Embedded logic	✅	⚠️
.sql	Queries	✅	⚠️


⸻

2. Syntax highlighting vs predictive coding (important distinction)

Syntax highlighting
→ Token-based (regex or grammar)
→ Colour, italics, weight, ligatures

Predictive coding / ghost text
→ Requires:
	•	Language Server Protocol (LSP)
	•	AST / type awareness
	•	Semantic tokens
	•	Model context (Copilot, local LLM, Ollama, etc)

Implication for uDOS

If your real logic lives in:

```udos
FIND duplicates
CLEAN binder

Then the editor must believe:
- this is a *language*
- with grammar
- with semantic meaning

That leads us directly to…

## 3. uDOS code blocks with their **own typographical voice**

This is the genuinely novel part.

### A. Code blocks already have identities
Today we have:
```md
```ts
```python
```bash

uDOS can introduce:

```udos
```ucode
```wizard
```mission

Each block = a dialect

⸻

B. “Typographical voice” = semantic typography

You’re not just colouring syntax — you’re expressing intent.

uDOS Block Type	Font (Monaspace)	Typographic Traits
udos	Monaspace Argon	Neutral, system-like
ucode	Monaspace Xenon	Mechanical, precise
wizard	Monaspace Krypton	Experimental, italic accents
mission	Monaspace Neon	Human-readable, airy
ts	Monaspace Argon	Standard dev
md	System / Inter	Reading-first

Monaspace is perfect because:
	•	Variable axes
	•	Optical sizing
	•	Character width stability
	•	Controlled ligatures

⸻

C. Showing suggested after the fact code

This is the killer idea.

You want to visually distinguish:
	1.	User-authored
	2.	AI-suggested
	3.	AI-accepted
	4.	AI-rejected / stale

Typographic approach (not just colour)

State	Visual Treatment
User-written	Normal weight
AI suggestion (ghost)	Light weight + dashed underline
AI accepted	Normal weight + subtle dot marker
AI modified	Mixed weight (ligature break)
AI stale	Faded + strike-through dots

Monaspace supports:
	•	Fine weight deltas
	•	Ligature suppression per range
	•	Italic axes without italics

So the code literally tells a story.

⸻

4. How editors actually support this (today)

VS Code / Tauri / Mac App

All of this is achievable via:
	•	TextMate grammars (for udos)
	•	Semantic tokens (LSP)
	•	Font feature settings per scope
	•	Inline decorations (ghost text, provenance)
	•	Custom language server (even a simple one)

You can:
	•	Register udos as a language
	•	Assign Monaspace per language
	•	Toggle ligatures per scope
	•	Render AI provenance metadata invisibly in the file or sidecar DB

⸻

5. File extensions strategy for uDOS

You’re already close, but I’d suggest:

File	Purpose
*.md	Human-first document
*.script.md	Executable markdown
*.mission.md	Long-running plans
*.wizard.md	Experimental / dev
*.table.md	Structured parser input
*.ts	Real logic
*.db	Variables / state

The extension tells the editor how to think.

⸻

6. Big idea summary (this matters)

uDOS isn’t just “code in markdown”
It’s multi-voiced text, where typography reveals intent, origin, and authority.

Monaspace gives you:
	•	A readable narrative
	•	A programmable aesthetic
	•	Trust signals (what did I write vs what was suggested)

This is exactly how uDOS differentiates from:
	•	Notion (no semantics)
	•	VS Code (no narrative)
	•	Jupyter (no typographic truth)

uDOS table/data-compatible text formats → parsable into uDOS-table.db (SQLite)

These are the text-based formats that map cleanly into SQLite tables (and back out again), with minimal ambiguity.

1) Markdown-native tabular formats
	•	.table.md (uDOS canonical)
	•	Markdown tables (pipes) + optional frontmatter / directives.
	•	Best for: human-edited, reviewable datasets; import/export hub.
	•	.md (standard Markdown tables)
	•	Same as above, but not necessarily “declared” as a table file.
	•	Best for: small tables embedded in docs.

2) Delimited text (row/column)
	•	.csv (comma-separated)
	•	Best for: interoperability, exports from anything.
	•	.tsv (tab-separated)
	•	Best for: text fields containing commas; cleaner diffs in git.
	•	.psv / .txt (pipe-separated) (supported if declared)
	•	Best for: logs or ad-hoc exports.

3) Semi-structured data that becomes tables
	•	.json / .jsonl
	•	jsonl (one JSON object per line) is excellent for append-only logs → table rows.
	•	Best for: event logs, API captures, structured records.
	•	.yaml / .yml
	•	Great for “records” and config-like datasets.
	•	Best for: small-to-medium datasets you still want readable.
	•	.toml
	•	Similar to YAML but more constrained.
	•	Best for: config-as-data, small “registry” datasets.

4) Data query / transform sources
	•	.sql
	•	Schema + seed inserts + views.
	•	Best for: deterministic rebuilds, migrations, and reproducible tables.
	•	.ts / .js / .py
	•	As generators (transform scripts) that output .table.md, .csv, or write into the binder DB.
	•	Best for: cleaning, enrichment, merges, dedupe.

5) “Spreadsheet exports” (still text)
	•	.xlsx is not text, but is commonly imported and then normalised into .table.md / .csv → SQLite.
	•	In uDOS terms: treat XLSX as an ingest source, not a canonical source.

How the uMarkdown App works with Binders (folder-sandbox) + local DB access

A Binder is a folder/sandbox. Everything inside it can safely reference other binder-local assets without leaking outside.

Suggested binder layout:

MyBinder/
  binder.md                  # optional binder “home”
  uDOS-table.db              # binder-local SQLite database
  tables/
    customers.table.md
    orders.table.md
  scripts/
    sync.script.md
    clean.script.md
  imports/
    orders.csv
    leads.jsonl
  assets/
    notes.md

Binder-local database rules
	•	If uDOS-table.db exists in the same binder, any -script.md inside that binder can reference it with a relative binder handle, e.g.
	•	db: binder://uDOS-table.db (conceptual URI)
	•	Scripts cannot open DBs outside the binder unless the user explicitly grants it (keeps sandboxes clean).
	•	The app maintains a binder context: when a script runs, . (working directory) is the binder root.

Practical effect
	•	Drop a .csv into /imports
	•	Run scripts/sync.script.md
	•	It imports into uDOS-table.db
	•	Then tables can be exported back to .table.md for human review (or rendered as Notion-style tables later)

⸻

Breakpoint: when is SQLite overkill vs “just keep it as a Markdown table”?

You want a hard-ish rule so the app behaves predictably.

Default breakpoint (recommended)

Use Markdown table (.table.md) when all are true:
	•	≤ 200 rows
	•	≤ 20 columns
	•	≤ 50 KB file size (roughly)
	•	No joins needed; it’s basically one flat dataset
	•	Humans will read/edit it frequently

Use SQLite (uDOS-table.db) when any are true:
	•	> 200 rows or > 50 KB
	•	You need joins, indexes, dedupe, search, or filters often
	•	There are multiple related tables (e.g., customers + orders)
	•	Data is append-heavy (logs, events) → prefer .jsonl → DB
	•	You care about types (dates/numbers/booleans) and constraints

Convenience rule
	•	If it fits comfortably on a single screen in the editor and you’ll hand-edit it: .table.md
	•	If it’s something you’ll query more than you’ll edit: SQLite

⸻

Conversion behaviour (what the app should do)
	•	Import → normalise → store
	•	Source formats (.csv, .jsonl, .yaml) are imported into DB tables with inferred schema.
	•	Export for review
	•	Any DB table can be exported as:
	•	.table.md (best for review)
	•	.csv / .tsv (interop)
	•	Round-trip safety
	•	.table.md is the “human truth layer”
	•	uDOS-table.db is the “query truth layer”
	•	The app tracks a simple fingerprint so it knows what changed (file vs DB)

⸻

You can absolutely include XML, EML, Apple Numbers, and OpenOffice/LibreOffice formats as well. They just fall into a slightly different bucket: “import formats” (often zipped/packaged, or semi-structured) rather than “canonical text sources”.

Here’s how I’d fold them into the uDOS → uDOS-table.db pipeline cleanly.

Add these formats to the uDOS ingest list

1) XML

Extensions: .xml (plus XML-based variants)

How it maps to tables
	•	XML is hierarchical, so you need a mapping strategy:
	•	Record-list XML (common): <items><item>...</item></items> → straightforward rows
	•	Deep hierarchical XML: becomes either
	•	multiple related tables (parent/child tables), or
	•	a single table with a few JSON/text columns for nested structures

Best practice in uDOS
	•	Support an import directive alongside the file, e.g.:
	•	customers.xml + customers.map.md (or customers.import.md)
	•	If no map is provided, do a “reasonable default”:
	•	choose the most repeated node as the row entity
	•	flatten simple child elements into columns

2) EML (emails)

Extensions: .eml

What you can extract into DB
	•	emails table:
	•	message-id, date, from, to, cc, subject, text_body, html_body, thread refs, etc.
	•	attachments table:
	•	filename, mime_type, size, sha256, extracted_text (optional), saved_path
	•	email_headers table (optional, for forensic/debug)

Ingest approach
	•	Treat .eml as a container:
	•	Parse headers + bodies
	•	Store attachments into the binder (e.g. /attachments/)
	•	If attachments contain tables (.csv, .xlsx, .numbers, .ods), run the normal table import pipeline on them too

3) Apple Numbers

Extensions: .numbers

Reality check
	•	.numbers is a packaged format, not a simple text file.
	•	Best path is conversion during import.

Ingest approach (recommended)
	•	Convert .numbers → .xlsx or .csv (per sheet/table), then import as usual.
	•	Preserve provenance:
	•	store original .numbers under /imports/
	•	store generated intermediate under /imports/_converted/

4) OpenOffice / LibreOffice

Extensions:
	•	.ods (spreadsheets) ✅ very relevant
	•	.odt (documents) ⚠️ sometimes relevant (tables in docs)
	•	.odp (slides) usually not a “table source” unless you extract embedded tables

Ingest approach
	•	.ods → convert to .csv (per sheet) or .xlsx, then import.
	•	.odt → extract tables → .table.md or .csv → import (optional feature; useful for “tables buried in docs”)

5) Other “container” formats worth supporting

These are very uDOS-friendly in the long run:
	•	.mbox (mailbox exports)
	•	Essentially “many EMLs” in one file → import to emails table
	•	.ics (calendar events)
	•	Import into events table (great for Binders tied to projects)
	•	.vcf (contacts)
	•	Import into contacts table
	•	.html (tables on webpages / saved exports)
	•	Extract <table> → .table.md → DB
	•	.log / .txt (structured logs)
	•	If pattern-recognisable, import into “events” / “telemetry” tables

How this fits the Binder + sandbox model

Same rule as before:
	•	All imports land inside the Binder.
	•	All conversions happen inside the Binder.
	•	The binder’s uDOS-table.db is the only DB scripts can touch by default.

Suggested import structure:

MyBinder/
  uDOS-table.db
  imports/
    inbox.mbox
    lead_source.xml
    finance.numbers
    survey.ods
    _converted/
      finance.sheet1.csv
      survey.Sheet1.csv

Updated “SQLite vs Markdown table” breakpoint for these
	•	For spreadsheet-ish sources (.numbers, .ods, .xlsx):
	•	If after conversion a sheet is ≤ 200 rows and ≤ 20 cols, export it to .table.md as the editable representation, and optionally mirror it into SQLite.
	•	If bigger or multi-sheet relational: keep it primarily in SQLite and export .table.md only for “views” / summaries.
