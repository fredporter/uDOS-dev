Plus: almost everything you like from itch.io + GitHub homebrew will work perfectly in Windows “PC game mode” (controller, fullscreen, couch-style), with very little friction.

Let’s break it down cleanly.

⸻

✅ What Works Best in PC Game Mode (Windows)

Think fullscreen + controller + low friction.

⸻

🕹️ itch.io (Retro / NES / Homebrew) — BEST FIT

This is your strongest option.

✔ Why itch.io works so well
	•	Native Windows builds (.exe)
	•	Many games support controller out of the box
	•	Easy fullscreen
	•	No emulator setup needed (often)

🔎 What to filter for on itch.io

Use these tags:
	•	retro
	•	NES
	•	Game Boy
	•	pixel-art
	•	controller
	•	free

🎮 Formats you’ll see

Format	PC Game Mode?	Notes
.exe	✅ Perfect	Launch like any PC game
Browser (HTML5)	⚠️ Mostly	Use fullscreen + controller mapper
ROM files	⚠️ Needs emulator	Still fine, one extra step

⭐ Standout free retro games
	•	Cave Story (Freeware)
	•	Spelunky Classic
	•	Celeste Classic
	•	Deltarune (Ch 1–2)
	•	PICO-8 games (via browser or launcher)

⸻

🧪 GitHub Homebrew (NES / GB / GBC) — WORKS, WITH SETUP

These are fantastic, but they’re usually ROM files, not PC executables.

✔ How they fit into PC Game Mode

They work extremely well if you use:
	•	RetroArch (recommended)
	•	OR standalone emulators

🎮 Typical formats

File	Meaning	PC Mode
.nes	NES ROM	✅
.gb / .gbc	Game Boy / Color	✅
.p8	PICO-8	✅ (via player)

🔧 Recommended setup (once)
	1.	Install RetroArch
	2.	Add:
	•	NES core (FCEUmm or Nestopia)
	•	GB/GBC core (Gambatte)
	3.	Scan ROM folder
	4.	Map controller once
	5.	Done forever

After that → it behaves like a console.

⸻

🎮 Controller Support (Important for PC Game Mode)

Best controller experiences
	•	itch.io .exe games
	•	RetroArch (excellent controller handling)

Controllers that “just work”
	•	Xbox controller (native Windows support)
	•	PS4/PS5 controller (via Steam Input)
	•	8BitDo (highly recommended for retro)

⸻

🛋️ Couch-Friendly Setup (Highly Recommended)

If “PC Game Mode” means couch / TV:

Option A – Steam as a launcher
	•	Add:
	•	itch.io games
	•	RetroArch
	•	Individual ROMs (optional)
	•	Use Big Picture Mode
	•	Instant console vibe

Option B – RetroArch as the hub
	•	Everything retro in one place
	•	Unified UI
	•	Shaders (CRT, scanlines)
	•	Save states

⸻

🧠 Quick Recommendation (Based on What You Like)

Since you specifically like:
	•	itch.io retro
	•	NES / GB homebrew from GitHub

👉 Best combo for you:

itch.io (native retro games)
+ RetroArch (for NES / GB homebrew ROMs)
+ Steam Big Picture (optional, for console feel)

This gives you:
	•	Zero-cost
	•	Legal
	•	Controller-first
	•	Fullscreen
	•	Minimal maintenance

RetroArch already supports this — we’re just using it properly.

⸻

🧠 How RetroArch Config Hierarchy Works

ASCII diagram (as requested 👇):

GLOBAL CONFIG
│
├── Core Overrides (NES, GB, etc)
│     ├── Video
│     ├── Audio
│     └── Input
│
└── Game Overrides (rare, optional)

👉 We will use:
	•	Global config → controller, latency, video
	•	Core overrides → NES vs GB differences

⸻

⚡ Step-by-Step: Create the Single Profile

⏱️ Step 1 — Global Settings (Do Once)

🎮 Controller (Global)

Settings → Input → Port 1 Binds

	•	Map controller
	•	D-Pad only (disable left stick if you want purity)

⸻

📺 Video (Global – Low Latency Safe Defaults)

Settings → Video

Set:
	•	Fullscreen: ✅ ON
	•	Windowed Fullscreen: ❌ OFF
	•	VSync: ✅ ON
	•	Hard GPU Sync: ✅ ON (if present)
	•	Threaded Video: ❌ OFF

🌐 What Is Netplay Co-Op?

Short version:

Netplay lets you play retro games online with friends as if you’re on the same couch.

⸻

🧠 How Netplay Works (Simple)

ASCII view:

YOU (Host)
│
├── Emulator sync
├── Same ROM
└── Same core
     │
     └── FRIEND (Client)

	•	One player hosts
	•	Others connect
	•	Inputs are synchronised, not video
	•	Feels like local multiplayer if latency is good

⸻

🎮 Best Use Cases

Netplay works best for:
	•	NES
	•	SNES
	•	GB/GBC
	•	Arcade
	•	Turn-based or slower games

Examples:
	•	Micro Mages
	•	Twin Dragons
	•	NES sports games
	•	Puzzle / co-op shooters

⸻

⚠️ Netplay Caveats (Important)

Be aware:
	•	Both players must use:
	•	Same ROM
	•	Same core
	•	Fast internet helps
	•	Wi-Fi works, Ethernet is better
	•	Not ideal for:
	•	Precision fighters
	•	Rhythm games

⸻

🚀 When Netplay Is Worth It

Use it when:
	•	You want couch co-op nostalgia
	•	You trust the connection

	•	Timing must be perfect

⸻
