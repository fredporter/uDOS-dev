# Stranger Things - 80s D&D Supernatural Theme

## Theme Overview

**Stranger Things** transforms your terminal into a 1980s Dungeons & Dragons campaign where the Upside Down lurks just beyond the veil. Every command is a turn in an epic adventure; every error is a demonic incursion; every success is a natural 20.

### Theme Identity

- **Era**: 1980s, when D&D ruled basements and Saturday mornings
- **Aesthetic**: Spooky nostalgia, tabletop adventure, upside-down weirdness
- **Tone**: Geeky enthusiasm mixed with supernatural dread, quirky humor
- **Emoji Set**: 📺 🎲 🕯️ ☠️ 🌀 🎸 ❌ 🪡 👹 ⚰️
- **Core Philosophy**: Every command is a quest; errors are interdimensional incursions

## Style Guide

### Punctuation & Tone

- **Ellipses are essential** (...): Use them constantly for suspense and mystery
- **Exclamation marks**: Save for excitement, victories, surprises!
- **Dashes**: Use for drama and pauses—like DM narration
- **Parentheses**: (whispered asides from the DM)

### Emoji Usage

Each emoji is sacred in the D&D world:
- 🎲 The dice themselves, fate, luck, results
- 📺 Mysterious communication, strange signals
- 🕯️ Light against darkness, uncertainty
- 👹 The Upside Down, interdimensional horror
- 🌀 Strangeness, weirdness, confusion
- 🎸 80s culture, the soundtrack of adventure
- ❌ Failure, denial, blocked paths
- 🪡 Protection magic, wards, barriers

### Formatting Examples

**Good Stranger Things flavor**:
```
📺 CAMPAIGN STATUS: The Hawkins Laboratory stands silent...
Waiting for the next expedition into the unknown.

🎲 NATURAL 20 ROLLED: Critical success! The party escapes!
The dice have spoken. The gods favor your courage.

🕯️ EERIE FEELING: Something stirs in the darkness...
The air grows thick with anticipation.

👹 DEMOGORGON BREACH: The ritual circle shattered!
The veil between worlds has torn asunder...
```

**Avoid**:
- Breaking the 80s D&D vibe
- Being too jokey or modern
- Losing the sense of wonder and creepiness

## Tips for Dungeon Masters

- **Always set the mood**: Every interaction is a moment in an epic saga
- **Respect the boundaries**: Permission checks are the protection circles
- **Celebrate victories**: Critical successes deserve celebration!
- **Acknowledge danger**: Warnings are the DM leaning forward with concern
- **Keep the 80s alive**: Walkie talkies, cassette tapes, basement adventures, first edition D&D

## Theme Integration Points

Stranger Things activates at:

1. **Startup** → Campaign begins
2. **Command Success** → Natural 20 messages
3. **Command Failure** → Demogorgon Breach errors
4. **Warnings** → Eerie Feeling cautions
5. **Status Queries** → Campaign Status reports
6. **File Operations** → Campaign/Character metaphors
7. **Long Operations** → Atmospheric flavor text
8. **Shutdown** → Session ends

### Display Pipeline

Stranger Things messages appear AFTER:
- ✅ Core execution complete
- ✅ Session logs recorded
- ✅ Error checking finished

This keeps debugging clear while making the user experience epic.
