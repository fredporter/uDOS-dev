# Vibe Setup: VS Code + Copilot + Offline Agent Context

> Preserve Agent instructions across devices using a shared context spine.

---

## Overview

Your setup uses **two kinds of instructions**:

1. **Project instructions** (portable, shared) → stored in repo (git)
2. **Personal/device instructions** (local, optional) → synced via VS Code Settings Sync or dotfiles

---

## 1. Project Instructions (In Repo)

These files travel with the repo on any machine and define how work happens:

### `.github/` Files

- **`AGENTS.md`** (root) — Canonical "how we work" rules
- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** — Repo-wide Copilot instructions
- **`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`** — Scoped instructions with `applyTo` globs:
  - `core.instructions.md` (applies to `core/**`)
  - `app.instructions.md` (applies to `app/**`)
  - `wizard.instructions.md` (applies to `wizard/**`)
  - `extensions.instructions.md` (applies to `extensions/**`)

### Documentation Spine (`/docs`)

- **`_index.md`** — Engineering index and entry point
- **`roadmap.md`** — Now/Next/Later
- **`devlog/YYYY-MM.md`** — Monthly development notes
- **`decisions/ADR-*.md`** — Architecture Decision Records (immutable)
- **`specs/*.md`** — Finalized technical specifications
- **`howto/*.md`** — Repeatable procedures

**Outcome:** Any device that clones the repo gets the same "brain."

---

## 2. VS Code Settings Sync (Device-Specific)

VS Code has built-in Settings Sync to preserve personal tooling across devices.

### Setup (Once Per Device)

```
VS Code → Manage (⚙️) → Backup and Sync Settings… → turn on
```

### What Gets Synced

- Settings
- Extensions
- Keybindings
- Snippets
- UI state preferences

**Note:** Settings Sync doesn't sync extensions into SSH/devcontainers/WSL the same way, but for uDOS that's fine — your truth is in-repo.

---

## 3. Vibe Configuration (Offline Agent)

Vibe (Mistral's CLI agent) looks for config in this order:

1. `./.vibe/config.toml` (project-local)
2. `~/.vibe/config.toml` (user fallback)

### Best Practice

- **Public defaults** → `/.vibe/config.toml` (in repo)
- **Secrets/machine overrides** → `~/.vibe/config.toml` (local-only, never git)

This way:

- Every device gets consistent behavior by default
- Secrets never land in git

### Example `.vibe/config.toml`

```toml
[project]
name = "uDOS"
version = "1.0.2.0"

[model]
# Offline-first by default
provider = "ollama"
model = "devstral-small-2"
endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:11434"

# Cloud routing disabled by default
# See docs/decisions/wizard-model-routing-policy.md
cloud_enabled = false

[context]
context_files = [
    "AGENTS.md",
    "docs/_index.md",
    "docs/roadmap.md",
    ".vibe/CONTEXT.md"
]

include = [
    "core/**/*.py",
    "app/**/*.{ts,svelte}",
    "wizard/**/*.py",
    "extensions/**/*.py",
    "docs/**/*.md",
    "*.md"
]

exclude = [
    "**/.dev/**",
    "**/.archive/**",
    "**/node_modules/**",
    "**/.venv/**",
    "**/dist/**",
    "**/target/**",
    "memory/**",
    "library/**",
    "**/__pycache__/**"
]
```

### `.vibe/CONTEXT.md` (Human-Readable Pointer)

```markdown
# uDOS Vibe Context

## Read First (in order)

1. AGENTS.md — How we work
2. docs/\_index.md — Engineering index
3. docs/roadmap.md — Current priorities
4. docs/decisions/ — Architecture decisions
5. docs/devlog/ — Recent work

## Subsystem Entry Points

- **Core**: core/README.md + core/docs/
- **App**: app-beta/README.md + app-beta/docs/
- **Wizard**: wizard/README.md
- **Extensions**: extensions/README.md
```

---

## 4. Cloud Routing (OpenRouter) — Optional, Secure

If you add OpenRouter for "burst capacity":

### Store Credentials Safely

- **Never commit real keys**
- Store in one of:
  - `wizard/config/*.json` (local-only, gitignored)
  - OS keychain (macOS: Keychain; Linux: Secret Service; Windows: Credential Manager)
  - Environment variables (CI/CD)

### Preserve Behavior via Policy

- **Policy** (in repo): `docs/decisions/wizard-model-routing-policy.md`
- **Keys** (local only): Wizard config or keychain
- **Routing**: Handled by Wizard Server

This separation means:

- You preserve "offline first, cloud when needed" policy in git
- Keys never leak
- Devices can have different keys (e.g., different OpenRouter quotas)

---

## 5. Sync Across Devices: The Complete Recipe

### Via Git (Portable)

```
AGENTS.md
.github/copilot-instructions.md
.github/instructions/*.instructions.md
/docs/**
.vibe/config.toml (NO secrets)
```

### Via VS Code Settings Sync (Personal)

```
Extensions
Settings
Snippets
Keybindings
```

### Via Dotfiles Manager or Manual (Secrets + Endpoints)

```
~/.vibe/config.toml (user overrides, if any)
Wizard/OpenRouter keys (local-only)
OS keychain entries
```

## 6. Quick Reference: What Lives Where

| Content                | Location              | Sync Method     | Notes                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Working rules          | AGENTS.md             | Git ✅          | Portable across devices     |
| Copilot instructions   | .github/instructions/ | Git ✅          | Scoped per subsystem        |
| Dev log                | docs/devlog/          | Git ✅          | Monthly files               |
| Architecture decisions | docs/decisions/       | Git ✅          | Immutable, links to commits |
| Project roadmap        | docs/roadmap.md       | Git ✅          | Single source of truth      |
| Vibe defaults          | .vibe/config.toml     | Git ✅          | No secrets                  |
| Vibe user overrides    | ~/.vibe/config.toml   | Dotfiles/Manual | Per-device                  |
| OpenRouter keys        | wizard/config/        | Keychain/Env    | Never git                   |
| VS Code settings       | Settings Sync         | VS Code Sync    | Per-device UI prefs         |
| Extensions list        | Settings Sync         | VS Code Sync    | Keeps tooling consistent    |

## 7. Checklist: Activate This Setup

- [ ] Review `.vibe/config.toml` (already in repo)
- [ ] Review `.vibe/CONTEXT.md` (updated below)
- [ ] Run Vibe to confirm Ollama/Devstral is available:
  ```bash
  vibe chat "Hello, what is uDOS?"
  ```
- [ ] Enable VS Code Settings Sync (one time, per device)
- [ ] Confirm `.github/instructions/` exists and is scoped correctly
- [ ] Add any personal overrides to `~/.vibe/config.toml` (if needed)

---

## 8. Why This Matters

- **Offline-first**: Devstral runs locally; cloud is optional
- **Portable**: Git repo is self-contained; new device = same context
- **Secure**: Keys stay local; no secrets in git
- **Flexible**: Different devices can have different quotas/keys
- **Scalable**: Vibe, VS Code, and Copilot all read the same truth
